I was wondering whether ABS and traction control are related. Do they use the same sensors, or are they completely independent? I'm trying to understand how they work together during emergency braking or on wet roads.
I know both systems involve wheel-speed sensors, but I'm not sure if the control modules are separate. I recently had an issue where the traction control light came on after my ABS fault, and the technician said they were likely connected.
