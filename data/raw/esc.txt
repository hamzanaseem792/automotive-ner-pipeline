Electronic stability control (ESC), also referred to as electronic stability program (ESP) or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology[1][2] that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding).[3] When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help steer the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer, or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps reduce the chance of the driver losing control of the vehicle on a slippery road.
According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2004 and 2006, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by the use of this technology.[4][5] In Europe the electronic stability program had saved an estimated 15,000 lives as of 2020. ESC became mandatory in new cars in Canada, the US, and the European Union in 2011, 2012, and 2014, respectively. Worldwide, 82 percent of all new passenger cars feature the anti-skid system.[6]
