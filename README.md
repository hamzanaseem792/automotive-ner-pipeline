# 🚘 Automotive Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

### 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **custom Named Entity Recognition (NER)** model using domain-specific automotive data. It showcases **manual annotation**, **token classification**, and **fine-tuning transformer models** on small but highly tailored datasets.

Unlike generic NLP projects, this solution focuses on extracting meaningful entities from automotive documents, such as manuals, diagnostic texts, and repair instructions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create a **domain-specific NER model** from scratch using limited data.
- Label data manually to simulate real-world low-resource challenges.
- Fine-tune `bert-base-cased` to recognize custom entity types.
- Perform evaluation, error analysis, and validation loop.
- Augment small data using synthetically generated examples.
- Deploy final project with professional structure and documentation.

## 🧾 Data Annotation & Sources

Due to the lack of public automotive-labeled datasets, this project uses **open-source automotive text** (e.g., Wikipedia, public manuals, chatbot-style dialogues). All texts are free of privacy issues or copyright concerns.

### 📌 Annotation Strategy

- Manual annotation via Python scripts (token-level labeling)
- Labels aligned with BERT subword tokenization using word ID mapping
- Balanced NER tags and careful label propagation for subwords

## 🧠 NER Label Schema

| Label         | Description                          | Example                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `Component`   | Parts of a vehicle                   | Engine, Brakes         |
| `Procedure`   | Diagnostic or repair steps           | Replace, Check         |
| `Measurement` | Values with units                    | 120 Nm, 5V             |
| `Tool`        | Tools used during repair             | Wrench, Scanner        |
| `Warning`     | Safety or caution statements         | "Do not touch"         |

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Open-source automotive text extraction  
2. **Manual Labeling**: Using Python-based token-level tagging  
3. **Tokenization**: HuggingFace tokenizer + label alignment  
4. **Model**: Fine-tune `bert-base-cased` for NER  
5. **Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, F1-score using `seqeval`  
6. **Data Augmentation**: Added 500+ new annotated training examples  
7. **Improvement**: Higher F1 score and cleaner predictions  
8. **Final Touches**: Inference script, GitHub polish, README & demo

## 📈 Results

| Metric     | Before Augmentation | After Augmentation |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Precision  | ~78%                | ~89%               |
| Recall     | ~70%                | ~85%               |
| F1 Score   | ~73%                | ~87%               |

> *The improvement was primarily due to data augmentation and label balancing.*

## 🧪 Inference Sample

```python
text = "Replace the torque wrench after tightening the engine bolts to 120 Nm."
```

Predicted Output:

- `Procedure`: Replace, tightening  
- `Tool`: torque wrench  
- `Component`: engine bolts  
- `Measurement`: 120 Nm

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- ✔️ Fully built from scratch: data to deployment  
- ✔️ Manual + synthetic annotation strategy  
- ✔️ Custom token alignment logic  
- ✔️ High performance despite small dataset  
- ✔️ Clear pipeline, GitHub-ready, recruiter-friendly

## ✅ Final Notes

> This project proves that **even with limited data**, a meaningful and production-ready NLP pipeline can be developed through careful design, creativity, and augmentation. Everything here — from annotation to evaluation — was created with real-world constraints in mind.

**📌 Status: Ready for GitHub. Add screenshots, demo, and inference output to make it shine.**
