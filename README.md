# Automotive_NER_Project


## Goal

Build a Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline for extracting key entities from automotive technical documents.

The goal is to extract useful information such as components, procedures, measurements, and warnings from automotive manuals, reports, and other domain-specific documents.

## Target Entities

- Component (Engine, Battery, Sensor)
- Procedure (Repair step, Diagnosis step)
- Measurement (Torque, Voltage, Pressure)
- Warning (Safety warning)
- Tool (Wrench, Tester device)
